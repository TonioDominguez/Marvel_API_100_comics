Hey, how's it going? :wink:

In this small project, I play around with the fantastic
[API de Marvel Comics](https://developer.marvel.com/), obtaining a **DataFrame** with **the latest 100 comics** 
published by Marvel **in the year 2023** using Python.

I **gather**, **clean**, **group**, and **analyze data** in two Jupyter Notebooks
([datamining](https://github.com/TonioDominguez/Marvel_API_100_comics/blob/main/data/marvel_datamining.ipynb) and [datawrangling](https://github.com/TonioDominguez/Marvel_API_100_comics/blob/main/data/marvel_datawrangling_and_interpretation.ipynb) ) 
where I describe the steps of what I do and why.

Hope you enjoy it and it sparks some ideas for you!

*Cheers!* :vulcan_salute:
